## --- AI Task & Requirements ---

### 1. Topic Identification

-   From the "PDF Chapter Number" provided, identify the main title or theme of that chapter.
-   Create a `topicId` using this chapter name, formatted as lowercase words separated by hyphens, and append the "Target Grade/Class Suffix".
-   **Example:** If the chapter is "Laws of Motion" and the suffix is "9th", the `topicId` must be `laws-of-motion-9th`.

### 2. Question Content & Types

-   Generate the specified "Number of Questions to Generate".
-   **Independence:** Questions must be self-contained. Do NOT refer to previous questions (e.g., "In the question above...") or specific page/figure numbers from the PDF.
-   **Strictly MCQ:** All questions must have exactly four options, labeled "a", "b", "c", and "d".
-   **Content Source Mix:**
    -   **70% "In-PDF":** Directly based on the text, diagrams, and concepts from the specified PDF chapter.
    -   **20% "Application-Based":** More challenging questions requiring a deeper application of the chapter's concepts.
    -   **10% "Beyond-PDF":** Questions that are directly related to the chapter's core theme but may not be explicitly answered in the text, encouraging broader knowledge.
-   **Question Type Distribution (Include a mix of these):**
    -   **Standard MCQ:** A direct question with four distinct options.
    -   **"How many statements are true/false?" MCQ:** Present 3-5 short statements. Options must be structured like: a) Only 1 is true, b) Only 2 are true, c) All are true, d) None are true.
    -   **Assertion-Reason MCQ:** Provide an Assertion (A) and a Reason (R). Options must be structured exactly like this:
        -   a) Both A and R are true, and R is the correct explanation of A.
        -   b) Both A and R are true, but R is NOT the correct explanation of A.
        -   c) A is true, but R is false.
        -   d) A is false, but R is true.

### 3. Mathematical Equation Formatting (KaTeX)

-   All mathematical formulas, variables, and equations MUST be formatted for KaTeX rendering.
-   **Inline Math:** Use single dollar signs. Example: `The value of $\pi$ is approx 3.14.`
-   **Block/Display Math:** Use double dollar signs. Example: `The equation is $$E = mc^2$$`
-   **JSON Requirement (CRITICAL):** Inside the JSON string, all backslashes (`\`) in LaTeX commands MUST be escaped with a second backslash (`\\`).
-   **KaTeX Command Examples:**
    -   Fraction: `\\frac{a}{b}`
    -   Square Root: `\\sqrt{x}`
    -   Integral: `\\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \\,dx`
    -   Subscript: `x_1`
    -   Superscript: `x^2`

-   **Example of a question with KaTeX in JSON:**
    ```json
    "text": "The quadratic formula is used to solve equations of the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$. Which of the following correctly represents this formula?",
    "options": [
      { "id": "a", "text": "$x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2c}$" },
      { "id": "b", "text": "$x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$" }
    ],
    ```

### 4. Difficulty Distribution & Rating

-   Assign a `difficulty` rating (as an integer) to each question based on this scale:
    -   **Easy (30% of questions):** Integer between `11-13`.
    -   **Medium (40% of questions):** Integer between `14-17`.
    -   **Hard (30% of questions):** Integer between `18-20`.

### 5. JSON Output Format

-   The ENTIRE output must be a single, valid JSON array of question objects. Do not include any text, comments, or explanations outside of the JSON array.
-   Each question object MUST follow this exact structure:
    ```json
    {
      "id": "topicId-qXXX",
      "topicId": "actual-topic-id-you-generated",
      "text": "Question text, including any $inline$ or $$display$$ KaTeX formulas.",
      "options": [
        { "id": "a", "text": "Option A text, with escaped \\KaTeX if needed." },
        { "id": "b", "text": "Option B text." },
        { "id": "c", "text": "Option C text." },
        { "id": "d", "text": "Option D text." }
      ],
      "correctOptionId": "a",
      "explanation": "Detailed explanation. If based on the PDF, cite the page number like this at the end: (Page XXX). Format any math in the explanation with KaTeX and \\\\escaped backslashes.",
      "difficulty": 16
    }
    ```
-   **`id` field:** Must be unique. Use the format `topicId-qXXX`, where `XXX` is a zero-padded, 3-digit number starting from the "Starting Question Number" (e.g., `q001`, `q025`, `q125`).
-   **`topicId` field:** Use the `topicId` you generated in Step 1.
-   **`explanation` field:** Provide a clear explanation. **Crucially**, if the answer is in the PDF, include the page number in the format `(Page XXX)` at the very end.

### --- Final Check ---
1.  Is the output a single, valid JSON array?
2.  Are all backslashes in LaTeX commands properly escaped (`\\`)?
3.  Is there absolutely no text outside of the `[` and `]` of the JSON array?
