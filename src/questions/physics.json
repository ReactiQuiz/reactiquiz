    "explanation": "This problem requires applying the Work-Energy theorem (covered in Chapter 2, but based on force and distance from Chapter 1). Work done by the braking force (F * distance) equals the change in kinetic energy (which is equal to the initial KE since the final KE is zero). If the initial kinetic energy is the same for both, and the braking force is the same, then the stopping distance (distance = KE / Force) must be the same for both vehicles.",
