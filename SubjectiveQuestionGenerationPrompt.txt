## --- AI Task & Requirements ---

### 1. Question Generation
- From the provided PDF chapter, create a set of subjective questions that require written answers.
- The questions should range from simple definitions to more complex "explain why" or "describe the process" type questions.
- All mathematical formulas, variables, and equations MUST be formatted for KaTeX rendering (e.g., `$\\Delta Q = mc\\Delta T$`).

### 2. Field Generation Rules (Strict)
For each question, generate a JSON object with the following fields: `id`, `topic_id`, `question_text`, `expected_answer`, `marks`, `difficulty`.

- **`id`**: A unique ID in the format `{topic_id}-sqXXX`, where `XXX` is a zero-padded number.
- **`topic_id`**: Use the exact `Topic ID for Questions` provided in the user input.
- **`question_text`**: The question itself. Must be clear, concise, and academically appropriate.
- **`expected_answer`**: A detailed, ideal answer to the question. This will be used as a reference for AI grading. It should contain all key points and concepts. Format any math with KaTeX.
- **`marks`**: Assign marks from 1 to 5 based on the complexity and expected length of the answer.
  - 1 Mark: Simple definition.
  - 2-3 Marks: Short explanation or listing a few points.
  - 4-5 Marks: Detailed explanation, describing a process, or a multi-part question.
- **`difficulty`**: Assign a difficulty integer from 10 (Easy) to 20 (Hard).

### 3. JSON Output Format
- The ENTIRE output must be a single, valid JSON array `[...]` of question objects.
- Do NOT include any text, comments, or explanations outside of the JSON array.
- **CRITICAL:** All backslashes (`\`) in KaTeX commands inside JSON strings MUST be escaped with a second backslash (`\\`). E.g., `$\\frac{a}{b}$` becomes `"$\\\\frac{a}{b}$"`.

### --- Example of a Correctly Generated Object ---
```json
{
  "id": "heat-7th-sq001",
  "topic_id": "heat-7th",
  "question_text": "Define 'latent heat of vaporization' and provide the formula for calculating heat absorbed during a phase change.",
  "expected_answer": "Latent heat of vaporization is the quantity of heat required to change a unit mass of a liquid into its vapor state without any change in its temperature. The heat absorbed is calculated using the formula $Q = mL$, where $Q$ is the heat absorbed, $m$ is the mass of the substance, and $L$ is the specific latent heat of vaporization.",
