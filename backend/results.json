        "explanation": "According to Newton's second law, Force = Rate of change of momentum (Δp/Δt). Therefore, Δp = Force × Δt. If the same force (F) acts for the same time interval (Δt) on different objects, the change in momentum (Δp), also known as impulse, will be the same for all objects. Their accelerations and changes in velocity would differ if their masses are different.",
