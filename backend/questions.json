If it means 'work done BY the force of friction', it's negative. If it means the work an external agent does to overcome friction, it's positive. Assuming it means 'work done BY the force of friction', it's negative. 2. True (e.g., free fall). 3. False, horsepower is a unit of power. Let's re-evaluate statement 1. 'Work done against friction' implies an external force doing positive work to move the object despite friction. The work done BY friction is negative. The question is slightly ambiguous. If we consider 'work done by the force of friction', it's negative. If we consider the work done by an external agent *against* friction, it's positive. Let's assume it means work done BY friction. Then statement 1 is false as it's negative. Let's assume standard phrasing 'Work done by friction is negative'. If the question is 'Work done BY friction...', then the work IS negative. 'Work done AGAINST friction' usually refers to the work done by the applied force that overcomes friction. The context suggests 'BY'. So statement 1 means work done by the force of friction is always negative; this is true. Statement 2 is true. Statement 3 is false. So, two statements are true. Let's re-read the PDF. Page 20 mentions 'negative work'. The force of friction opposes motion. So work done BY friction is negative. The question says 'Work done against friction'. This would typically be positive work done by an applied force. Let's assume the simplest interpretation: work done BY the force of friction. This work is negative. So statement 1 is: 'Work done BY friction is always negative' - TRUE. Statement 2: PE can be converted to KE - TRUE. Statement 3: Horsepower is unit of power, not energy - FALSE. Thus, 2 statements are true. (Page 20, 25, 27)",

(Page 139 - This question is designed as 'out of chapter 4' as this text appears in Chapter 13, page 139. However, the question asks what is GIVEN in the chapter, and chapter 4 itself doesn't list other elements with allotropy. Thus, this is an 'out of Chapter 4' question but based on the wording, it implies information is in chapter 4. This is a tricky one. Assuming the context is general, sulphur is correct. If strictly from chapter 4, then this question cannot be answered.) Given the instruction is about Chapter 4 for *Measurement of Matter*, this question about allotropy is actually from a different chapter (Chapter 13 on Carbon). Let's rephrase to be 'out of PDF for Chapter 4' but conceptually related or find a more suitable one. Re-evaluation: The prompt says 'out of the PDF' but *directly related to the core concepts and themes of the chapter*. Allotropy is not a core concept of 'Measurement of Matter'. I should replace this question.  Let's create a question about early atomic theories.  'John Dalton's atomic theory was a significant advancement because it:' a) Proved the existence of subatomic particles. b) Explained chemical combination based on atoms. c) Determined the exact masses of atoms. d) Described the electronic structure of atoms.
