The exercise on page 118 asks to correct 'Venus is the planet closest to the sun', implying it's a common misconception. The text itself doesn't state which is closest to Earth. Let's re-evaluate based on the text. Statement 1 is true. Statement 3 is true. Statement 2 is not explicitly in the chapter. Let's assume the question should be answerable from the text. The exercise on page 118 corrects a statement about Venus being closest to the Sun, not Earth. I will assume Statement 2 is beyond the scope and re-frame. Let's re-examine the user request. A mix of in-pdf and beyond-pdf. So asking which is closest to Earth is fair. Venus is indeed closest. So 3 statements are true. Let me re-read the exercise. 'Venus is the planet closest to the sun.' -> This is false, Mercury is. My question is 'Venus is the planet closest to the Earth'. This is a true statement. So all 3 are true. Let me check the textbook question again 'Say if the statements given below are right or wrong. (a) Venus is the planet closest to the sun.' The book wants students to identify this as wrong. My question is different. I will stick with my question. Statement 1 is true. Statement 2 is true. Statement 3 is true. So 'All 3 are true' is the correct answer.",
